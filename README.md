üîç Key improvements over YOLOv8:
- Higher mAP on benchmark datasets
- Faster inference times
- Smarter architectural tweaks that enhance feature learning
- Designed for complex scenes such as target occlusion and low-contrast scenes.

üß± Key Blocks:
- Ghost Convolution -> more features through cheaper operations
- Lightweight Depth Ghost Convolution -> makes the Bottleneck lighter
- Channel Shuffle -> improves the richness of the features
- Coordinate Attention -> pays attention to every pixel
