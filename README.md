# YOLOv8-Improved-2025
This is an unofficial implementation of the paper titled "Improvement of Yolov8 Object Detection Based on Lightweight Neck Model for Complex Images" (https://www.ias-iss.org/ojs/IAS/article/view/3514)

### Model Architecture

<br/>

üîç Key improvements over YOLOv8:
- Higher mAP on benchmark datasets
- Faster inference times
- Smarter architectural tweaks that enhance feature learning
- Designed for complex scenes such as target occlusion and low-contrast scenes.

<br/>
<br/>

üß± Key Blocks:
- Ghost Convolution -> more features through cheaper operations
- Lightweight Depth Ghost Convolution -> makes the Bottleneck lighter
- Channel Shuffle -> improves the richness of the features
- Coordinate Attention -> pays attention to every pixel

<br/>
<br/>

### Model Variants
- Nano (n)
- Small (s)
- Medium (m)
- Large (l)
- Extra Large (x)

<br/>
<br/>

### Model Usage
```
from model import YoloV8I, YoloV8I_CONFIGS

# Model
model_type = "m"
model_config = YoloV8I_CONFIGS[model_type]
model_config.num_classes = 80

# Detection
model = YoloV8I(model_config, task="det")

# Segmentation
model = YoloV8I(model_config, task="seg")

# Export
model = YoloV8I(model_config, task="seg", export=True)
```

<br/>
<br/>

### Model Comparisons
<br/>
Note: These profiling were performed on RTX 3080 with num_classes = 80 and batch_size = 16; with export=True
